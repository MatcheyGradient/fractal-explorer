# Fractal Explorer
Slow but cool mandelbrot and julia set explorer in java.

## Controls
- Zoom in: 0
- Zoom out: 9
- Move left/right: Left Arrow / Right Arrow
- Move up/down: Up Arrow / Down Arrow

### You can also highlight a box to zoom in on the highlighted section.
- Its a bit buggy and can only make a box to the bottom-right.

### Control the set
- Reset Iterations and Position to beginning
- Increase/Decrease iterations: D / A
- Switch from Mandelbrot set to Julia set: S
- Cycle between 3 color options: C
  - (Random (pre - made), Black and White, Rainbow

## How the Julia set functionality works
The julia set constants will be based on the MouseX and MouseY respective to the window.  
The real constant is based on the MouseX and the imaginary constant is based on the MouseY.  

If you want to change the Random colors, you can randomize it by pressing X.

Yeah.. its a bit messy but just mess around with the numbers and really cool colors can pop out!  
Hvae fun.
